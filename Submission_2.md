## Modifications
* added SMS content to the SMS table
* modified send time in SMS and calls to a datetime
* answered support tickets also show a response
* purchase time also includes time of purchase now
* fix email in employee table
* more data diversity in ??? calling table / support ticket maybe

## Views and Grants
Customer -
 info table: phone number / username / current tower / balance
 call history view - read
 SMS history view - read
 money view - ability to alter balance column, but only if it increases

Sales -
  view with top 10 plans and their income
  ability to alter plan data

Administrator
  access to defaulter view
  permission to activate or deactivate SIMs 

## Triggers
1) Create a trigger that raises the number of calls by one for both caller and callee when a call is made

```SQL
CREATE TRIGGER called AFTER INSERT ON call_table  
FOR EACH ROW  
	BEGIN 
		UPDATE usage_calling SET calls = CASE  
		WHEN phone_number = caller THEN calls + 1  
		WHEN phone_number = callee THEN calls + 1  
		ELSE calls  
	END;  
END
```

## Indices
* on aadhaar card in customer, in case someone wants to do lookup by aadhaar card
* in phone number on customer to do lookup on (a single) customer by phone number
* on tower by name to get tower ID from name (e.g. we want a query that finds all SIM cards in mumbai. for this, we would need the ID of mumbai, which is O(n) to seek for without an index. So we also store the reverse of ID->city name mapping)
* on employee by employee email, so that the employer can conveniently see employee name from an e-mail that they receive from the employee

## Advanced Queries

1) As a part of BadaFone's reference programme, rewards are given to anyone who refers someone to join BadaFone. To avail this offer, the referrer must be called by the referree. To prevent people from gaming the system, they also want to ensure that both people are in different cities. For the first phase, this programme is only available to Mumbai customers. Make a function to find the city that a phone is currently in, and use it to find customers who may have availed this offer.

```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION location_of (s_t bigint)  
    RETURNS varchar(50) READS SQL DATA  
 RETURN (
   SELECT city  
   FROM sim_card INNER JOIN tower  
   ON sim_card.current_tower = tower.tower_ID  
   WHERE sim_card.phone_number = s_t  
   LIMIT 1
 );

SELECT callee, location_of(callee), location_of(caller) FROM call_table  
WHERE location_of(callee) <> location_of(caller)  
AND location_of(callee) = 'Mumbai'
```

2) BadaFone's R&D department is once again having a strange idea. They think that the chance of having a person using excess data depends on their payment method. Hector suggests promoting plans with larger data plans to people who use UPI, because they're more likely to exceed their limits. He wants you to verify his claim. Make a function to check whether or not a person is a defaulter, and use this to check his claim.

```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION is_defaulter(phone_num bigint)  
    RETURNS tinyint(1) READS SQL DATA  
 RETURN (  
   SELECT COUNT(*)  
   FROM usage_data  
     INNER JOIN plan_data p on usage_data.plan_ID = p.plan_ID  
     INNER JOIN sim_card sc on usage_data.phone_number = sc.phone_number  
   WHERE 
     data_used >= data_limit  
     AND sc.phone_number = phone_num  
 );

SELECT payment_method, COUNT(*) as num_defaulters  
FROM wallet  
WHERE is_defaulter(phone_number)  
GROUP BY payment_method
```

3) Seth from the R&D department has a hypothesis. Messages at 5\~7 PM have a higher chance of being read by the receiver than messages sent between 5\~7 AM. Sonia, on the other hand, argues that the discrepancy is only because less messages are sent in the morning, because most people are asleep. The manager asks you to make a table so that they can pass a verdict on Seth's argument.

```SQL
SELECT HOUR(send_time) AS hour, `read`, COUNT(*) AS quantity  
FROM SMS  
GROUP BY HOUR(send_time), `read` WITH ROLLUP
```

4) Robin looked at this data and got another idea. He thinks you should divide the day into four quarters. If you do so you will notice that the first quarter has much less of an SMS count. He also says that this pattern doesn't hold for people who are roaming. Because they're travelling, they're equally likely to send messages in the morning as they are in the evening. Seth thinks this is nonsense, and asks you to make a table to prove Robin wrong.

```SQL
SELECT HOUR(send_time) DIV 6 AS period,  
 roaming,  
 `read`,  
 COUNT(*) as quantity  
FROM SMS INNER JOIN sim_card sc on sms.receiver = sc.phone_number  
GROUP BY HOUR(send_time) DIV 6, roaming, `read` WITH ROLLUP
```

5) Rank each plan by sales, partition them over validity, then perform windowing in each partition so as to make a cumulative distribution table

```SQL
SELECT validity, plan.name,  
COUNT(*) * plan.price AS individual_sale,  
SUM(COUNT(*) * plan.price) over(  
    PARTITION BY validity  
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) * plan.price DESC  
    ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING 
) AS cum_sale  
FROM subscription  
INNER JOIN plan 
    ON subscription.plan_ID = plan.plan_ID  
GROUP BY plan.plan_ID
```

6) Cut prices of all plans of the `super` category to 50% for a flash sale, and prices of all `maha` plans to 70% 

```SQL
UPDATE plan SET price = 
	CASE 
		WHEN plan_name like 'super%' 
			THEN 0.5 * price
		WHEN plan_name like 'maha%'
			THEN 0.7 * price
		ELSE
			1 * price
	END
```
