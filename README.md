# DBMS_project
This project creates a simulation of a telecom industry database for a company Badafone Inc. 
Its implementation factors in information regarding calls, SMSes, call and data plans, data used by each consumer, customer care queries, customer wallets, etc. 
We have used MySQL and Django for implementing the back end development, and HTML and CSS for front end styling. 
We have imported the front end designs from Figma that were exported as HTML files.
For our first submission, we took upon ER-diagrams, relational schemas, data population, and writing basic SQL queries for the database.
For the second and final submission, we created a proper front end and back end implementation for the database, while incorporating advanced SQL concepts.
These advaned concepts include views, grants, embedded SQL querries, query optimization, indexing, triggers, SQL functions, rollups, ranking and windowing for the database.
